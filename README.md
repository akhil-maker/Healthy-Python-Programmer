# Healthy-Python-Programmer
This program is created to keep oneself healthy.
In this program, I have added alarm to help a programmer to take care by taking certain things.
One can take water sip in regular intervals which is necessary so it will remind to take water on time by alarming with a sound.
This program will also help to give rest to eyes which are working continuously before the screen.
It also helps to take a walk or do some physical activity during any continuous work if body got stuck sitting at a place.
